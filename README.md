## Fresh Wash
Fresh Wash is a car wash web app designed for corporations with fleets of vehicles.  Cars can be added, edited, and deleted from a user's profile. Car Wash packages can be selected for each vehicle. This app is built entirely on Ruby on Rails. There is user authentication through email or through the Facebook OAth gem.  Bcrypt encrypts password for users that use the email login. Users are also able to see an Order History page displaying the wash packages selected for each particular car. TailwindCSS is used for page styling throughout the app.
